# DBMS-Online-Retail-Store
Using Python language and MYSQL, created an online retail store implementing the database concepts ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability.

### Scope:
Today, due to the extremely fast-paced lives of people, it can be exhausting and time-consuming
to visit different stores at different locations. Visiting a market and choosing the right product is
cumbersome and may take several hours. Also, due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, people
prefer to get products delivered to their doorstep as quickly as possible.
Therefore, to cater to the needs of the public, we provide complete management solutions to
manage information on customers, sellers, delivery agents and products efficiently.
A2Z gives the admins a forum to showcase their products of various categories to customers in
a hassle-free and systematic way. Customers can conveniently browse products, manage items
in the cart and buy as per their preferred payment method. Delivery agents are assigned orders
by the admin, which are supposed to be delivered within the stipulated time to provide an
excellent experience to customers. Each of the objects is identified by a unique attribute, i.e.,
their primary key - Customer_ID, Admin_ID, Delivery_Agent_ID, Order_ID, Product_ID and so
on.
This application will enable the admin, delivery agent and customer to interact and coordinate
efficiently with each other, resulting in a pleasant experience for all.
